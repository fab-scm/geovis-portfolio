# Introduction

This is my portfolio for the Geovisualization course at the University of Trier. Here you can find all the projects I have worked on during the semester.
The portfolio covers the following topics and aspects of Geovisualization:
- The key **principles of geovisualization**.
- **Methods and tools** used in geovisualization (especially geoinformation systems like QGIS and ArcGIS Pro).
- **Examples** of geovisualization based on the course material and exercises during the semester.
- The two main **projects** I worked on during the semester: 
  - The **flood project**, which is a geovisualization of the Moselle River in Trier, Germany, and different flood levels.
  - The **RUSLE project**, which is a geovisualization of soil erosion in western Kenia including als steps of the RUSLE model, analysing the soil loss in this region.

#### Own Contribution:

Instead of a further analysis in the RUSLE project I decided to take advantage of the opportunities and redo the analysis process in R.
As I planned to get involved in geocomputation with R for a long time, this gave me a good opportunity to explore some of the most important packages for raster and vector data analysis. Most important packages used to performm the analysis and generate the maps/plots are:
- `sf`: for vector data handling
- `terra`: for raster data handling
- `tmap`: for thematic mapping
