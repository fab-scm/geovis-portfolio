# Introduction

This is my portfolio for the Geovisualization course at the University of Trier. Here you can find all the projects I have worked on during the semester.
The portfolio covers the following topics and aspects of Geovisualization:
- The key **principles of geovisualization**.
- **Methods and tools** used in geovisualization (especially geoinformation systems like QGIS and ArcGIS Pro).
- **Examples** of geovisualization based on the course material and exercises during the semester.
- The two main **projects** I worked on during the semester: 
  - The **flood project**, which is a geovisualization of the Moselle River in Trier, Germany, and different flood levels.
  - The **RUSLE project**, which is a geovisualization of soil erosion in western Kenia including als steps of the RUSLE model, analysing the soil loss in this region.

**Own Contributions:**

Instead of extending the RUSLE project with further analysis, I took the opportunity to redo the whole workflow in R. 
This was the perfect chance to develop some skills in geocomputation with R, something I had long planned to explore
some of the most essential packages for raster and vector data analysis. The core packages used for the analysis and 
for generating maps and plots were:
- `sf`: for vector data handling
- `terra`: for raster data handling
- `tmap`: for thematic mapping
The R script with the associated code for the analysis and the maps is available on [GitHub](/about).
